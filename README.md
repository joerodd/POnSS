# POnSS

This repository contains the source code of an app for Django 1.9 implementing POnSS (Pipeline for Online Speech Segmentation).

POnSS is a browser-based system that is specialized for the task of segmenting the onsets and offsets of words, that combines automatic speech recognition with limited human input. In developing POnSS, we identified several sub-tasks of segmentation, and implemented each of these as separate interfaces for the annotators to interact with, to streamline their task as much as possible.
