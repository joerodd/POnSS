<div id = "messagetitle">Orthographic transcription</div>
<p>The idea is to transcribe chunks of speech orthographically.</p>
<p>The chunks were made automatically by a silence detection algorithm. Sometimes they are short, sometimes they are long.</p>
<p>You have to listen to the recording (tab) and write in the box what you hear, with normal Dutch spelling. </p>
<p> if the chunk is long, then only the first part is selected. You can move the cursors with the mouse to the next part, or you can press the
' key. This moves the left cursor to the location of the right cursor, and the right cursor to 1.5 seconds after that.</p>
<p>To save some key strokes, the system suggests words as you type. To accept the suggestion, press the . key.</p>
<p>Please record disfluencies that actually resulted in sound orthographically, separated from neigbouring successful words by a space. </p>
<p>Please record substituted or mispronounced words orthographically. Please use only lowercase letters, with no punctuation or numbers</p>
<p> When you're done, you can click the green bar, or press the = key. </p>

<p>If a short (single word) chunk is missing part of a word, you can press the flag button. Then, the chunk will be made longer, and can be retranscribed.</p>
<p>If there is no speech, press the double thumbs down button. If there is some speech and a non-speech sound, transcribe the sound as best you can, so that
the recogniser might identify it. For example, for a keyboard sound, you could type 'tsch'.</p>
<p>If at the beginning or the end of the chunk, less than a whole syllable missing and you can clearly identify the word, transcribe it as of that word
    was complete. In the retrimming, that will get fixed. Otherwise, transcribe just what you hear. The part words will get revisited revisited later.
</p>
