<div id = "messagetitle">Joe's error counting task (Autumn 2018)</div>
<p>The idea is to check which words were actually said by the participants. We do that by filling in the words they actually said in the boxes.</p>
<p>to make this quicker, you can click the <img src="/static/images/icons%20errors-01.png" width=50px> buttons to insert the expected words into the boxes. Keys 1 - 8 operate these buttons too.
    You can press the <img src="/static/images/icons%20errors-03.png" width=50px> button or the 0 key to insert all 8 words in one go. </p>
<p>Please record disfluencies that actually resulted in sound orthographically, in the box before the next word. Silent pauses do not need to be recorded.
Don't record disfluencies after a correctly produced word.</p>
<p>Please record substituted or mispronounced words orthographically.</p>
<p> When you're done, you can click on the button to the right, or press the = key. </p>
<p> You can use the left and right cursors to listen to only part of the recording. The location of these cursors doesn't get stored, they are only there so you don't have to listen to the whole recording every time. To listen again, press the tab key.</p>
